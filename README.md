# current-imbalance

Current imbalance dynamics in two parallel-connected cells.

May 14, 2022

MATLAB 2021b was used to generate the code and run the simulations. 

To run, set the path to the root. Initialize the paths by running `setpath.m`.

Note: Do not run from `src` since the code assumes you are starting from one level up from `src.
