# current-imbalance
Current imbalance dynamics in parallel-connected cells

May 14, 2022

MATLAB 2021b was used to generate the code and run the simulations. To run, set the path to the root. Do not run from `src` since the code assumes you are starting from one level up from `src.)


## Next steps

- [ ] Understand why current imbalance does not depend on resistance
- [ ] Develop a simple model to link current imbalance and SOC imbalance to an incremental degradation per cycle


## To-Do's

- [ ] Refactor to take positive current as charge instead of discharge
- [ ] Implement CV hold dynamics
- [ ] Run `z_start --> `z_end` sweeps
